            <h1 id="intro">Introduction Before i Want to Pursue Tech Field Career</h1>
            <p>Ever since i was a child, i do not know what i would be when i grow up, but eventually during my elementary years, i realized that i love building blocks from the sandbox game Minecraft and Legos in real life, <strong>i decided to become an civil engineer</strong> because my mother's cousin and her uncle is a civil engineer.</p>

            <p>But during my junior high-school years, it was pandemic at that time, since i am chronologically with online stuff like i play games, watching online medias, social medias, and surfing websites all day during pandemic, that's when i realized, <strong>tech field could be my future career</strong> because i am very interested of creating some websites, create applications but i want to know the depth, so i decided to pursue ICT strand in my senior high-school.</p>

            <h1>My Experiences Towards The Journey of Software Developer</h1>
            <p>During my senior high-school days, my personal experiences about the ICT strand was not what i expected to be, i thought it was great because i could learn something from the professor's lectures, but in reality, <strong>i should be the to self-learn</strong> if i want to upskill, so create some pretty fun, easy, challenging, and interesting projects during my senior high-school years like i self-learn to create basic websites, coding, and other things.</p>

            <p>The one that i made that i am proudest of was <strong>Database Management System</strong> of the school, although it was just a mock prototype, at least i learn a lot of it by self-learning, not from my professor's lectures. I remembered i almost crash out from it because i was doing it myself and AI was useless at that time, the worst of it was <strong>i made it using VB.net</strong> (which is an ancient language that almost coders does not use it or heard of it) and finding the solutions feels like i am looking for hieroglyphs from the great pyramid.</p>

            <p>It was a struggling experience, but great at the same time because when i presented it, i feel like i was reincarnated as another person and my professor complimented me after that, that is when i realized, <strong>it's very rewarding if you self-learn</strong> and create something that you know you can learn a lot from it and <strong>gains you experience whether big or small.</strong></p>

            <h1 id="end">My Final Decision and my Thoughts About Being a Software Developer</h1>
            <p>Now i am a 2nd year BSIT student, since i created something the things i am proud of, i decided to upskill for my future career, my final decision is <strong>to become full-stack developer and work at big tech companies</strong> like Accenture, Shopee, and other business corporate companies with great environment and decent monthly salary as well.</p>

            <p>I am currently <strong>planning to self-learn great projects</strong> for my resume and build connections outside school to aim for landing a great job of Full-stack developer. I will also <strong>do side hustle</strong> to save money for my needs that are related to my future career.</p>

            <p>Although i created previous projects that i am proud of, i should not be complacent, instead i should be endlessly self-learn, learn with other people that i connected with and share the mistakes and learn from other's mistakes as well especially it's a tech field, where it keeps and progressively updating, trends that never stops from the cycles, <strong>It is very important to keep learning, otherwise i would get left behind</strong>.</p>
